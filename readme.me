We used a parser from Ollie Larking (https://github.com/olly-larkin/MIPS1_Simulator) to compile our text files into Binary

Alongside this, our testbench is heavily influenced by https://github.com/tharuraht/CompArch-MIPS-Project/tree/master/test as he implemented his binaries using Ollies parser Initialisations

Use make simulator to make Simulator

use make testbench to make the testbench
